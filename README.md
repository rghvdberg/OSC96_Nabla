##Project files for [One Synth Challenge 96](https://sites.google.com/site/kvrosc/osc-96-nabla)
####Software used in this project:
####* OS - [Linux Mint 18](https://linuxmint.com/) with [KX Studio repositories](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Repositories) added
####* DAW - [Ardour 5.6](https://ardour.org/)

All sounds are made by multiple instances of one synthesizer plugin. 
In this project the synth used is [Nabla](https://www.fullbucket.de/music/nabla.html) by Full Bucket Music.
Listen to this song on SoundCloud : https://soundcloud.com/rghvdberg/rghvdberg-clearly-broken-osc96
Although this project is made on Linux, Nabla is a Windows plugin and other Windows plugins have been used too.
In order to run a Windows plugin on linux I use [Airwave](https://github.com/phantom-code/airwave/releases). Very cool software, check it out.
