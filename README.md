# OSC96_Nabla
##Project files for [One Synth Challenge 96](https://sites.google.com/site/kvrosc/osc-96-nabla)
This is a work in progress music project beging made using:
* OS - [Linux Mint 18](https://linuxmint.com/) with [KX Studio repositories](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Repositories) added
* DAW - [Ardour 5.6](https://ardour.org/)

All sounds are made by multiple instances of one synthesizer plugin. 
In this project the synth used is [Nabla](https://www.fullbucket.de/music/nabla.html) by Full Bucket Music.
Although this project is made on Linux, Nabla is a Windows plugin. 
In order to run a Windows plugin on linux I use [Airwave](https://github.com/phantom-code/airwave/releases). Very cool software, check it out.

Plugins used (so far):
  * [Nabla](https://www.fullbucket.de/music/nabla.html) by Full Bucket Music
  * a-plugins (Ardour built-in plugins)
  * [LSP Project](http://lsp-plug.in/)  (compressors, eq)
  * [EQ10Q](http://eq10q.sourceforge.net/) (compressors, eq)
  * [TAL Filter 2](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-filter) by Togu Audio Line (for autopan)
